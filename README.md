CODE DIVISION :

*At first we each made their own version of the PSO/Particle/Function methods/classes in order to for each of us to understand how it works. Then we saw each other's code, made a unified approach and split the implementation into the following tasks (while adding things that were missing)

Elena Kane i6289291 - Implementation of Rastrigin and Rosenbrock. Implementation of Particle class in PSO  <br />
Nikolaos Ntantis i6273751 - Implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent. Implementation of Plot functions <br />
Ioannis Montesantos i6292068 - Implementation of Main function. Implementation of PSO class. <br />
